#+title: Finding duplicate problem

* What is Set ?
    Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

    Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

    A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
* Python code
class Solution:
    def hasDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        hashset = set()
        for n in nums:
            if n in hashset:
                return True
            else:
                hashset.add(n)
        return False
